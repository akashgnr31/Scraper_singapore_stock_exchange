So This application can download all four files
1.) WEBPXTICK_DT-*.zip
2.) TickData_structure.dat
3.) TC_*.txt
4.) TC_structure.dat
from the site https://www2.sgx.com/research-education/derivatives 

It can download both the historical data and todays file as per the user's instruction.

I have written this code under the assumption that it will run on a server which will always remain up.

It is an autonomous driven code. Each day the download instructions will be executed autonomously to download that days files. You need to execute the code only once to start the jobs.
